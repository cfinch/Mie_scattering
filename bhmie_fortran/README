C Subroutine BHMIE is the Bohren-Huffman Mie scattering subroutine
C    to calculate scattering and absorption by a homogenous isotropic
C    sphere.
C Given:
C    X = 2*pi*a/lambda
C    REFREL = (complex refr. index of sphere)/(real index of medium)
C    NANG = number of angles between 0 and 90 degrees
C           (will calculate 2*NANG-1 directions from 0 to 180 deg.)
C           if called with NANG<2, will set NANG=2 and will compute
C           scattering for theta=0,90,180.
C Returns:
C    S1(1 - 2*NANG-1) = -i*f_22 (incid. E perp. to scatt. plane,
C                                scatt. E perp. to scatt. plane)
C    S2(1 - 2*NANG-1) = -i*f_11 (incid. E parr. to scatt. plane,
C                                scatt. E parr. to scatt. plane)
C    QEXT = C_ext/pi*a**2 = efficiency factor for extinction
C    QSCA = C_sca/pi*a**2 = efficiency factor for scattering
C    QBACK = (dC_sca/domega)/pi*a**2
C          = backscattering efficiency [NB: this is (1/4*pi) smaller
C            than the "radar backscattering efficiency"; see Bohren &
C            Huffman 1983 pp. 120-123]
C    GSCA = <cos(theta)> for scattering

C Original program taken from Bohren and Huffman (1983), Appendix A
C Modified by B.T.Draine, Princeton Univ. Obs., 90/10/26
C in order to compute <cos(theta)>
C 91/05/07 (BTD): Modified to allow NANG=1
C 91/08/15 (BTD): Corrected error (failure to initialize P)
C 91/08/15 (BTD): Modified to enhance vectorizability.
C 91/08/15 (BTD): Modified to make NANG=2 if called with NANG=1
C 91/08/15 (BTD): Changed definition of QBACK.
C 92/01/08 (BTD): Converted to full double precision and double complex
C                 eliminated 2 unneed lines of code
C                 eliminated redundant variables (e.g. APSI,APSI0)
C                 renamed RN -> EN = double precision N
C                 Note that DOUBLE COMPLEX and DCMPLX are not part
C                 of f77 standard, so this version may not be fully
C                 portable.  In event that portable version is
C                 needed, use src/bhmie_f77.f
C 93/06/01 (BTD): Changed AMAX1 to generic function MAX
